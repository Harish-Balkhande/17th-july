Question 3: 
        Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping. So you have an array
called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy. Now that you are inside 
of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list,but you want to 
add a few more. Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the
shoppingList array, and add some new products into it.
