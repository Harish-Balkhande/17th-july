Question 7: 
        An integer number greater than 1 is called a p​ rime ​ if it cannot be 
divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself. In other words, 
n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n. 
For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder 
by 2, 3 and 4. Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval 
from 2 to n. For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7. P.S. The code should work 
for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value
